## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Building from Source

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Android Studio with Meta Spatial SDK
   - Java JDK 17+
   - Android SDK 34

2. **Clone and Build**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Guymestef/MQFTPServer.git
   cd MQFTPServer
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

3. **Release Build**:
   Use the provided PowerShell scripts for signed releases:
   ```powershell
   .\build-release-simple.ps1
   ```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Network Security
- Server only accessible on local network
- Default credentials should be changed for production use
- No HTTPS/FTPS support (planned for future versions)

### Storage Security  
- Server root is sandboxed to selected folder
- Path traversal protection implemented
- Read/write permissions respected

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server won't start**:
- Check storage permissions are granted
- Ensure port 2121 isn't already in use
- Verify WiFi connection is active

**Can't connect from computer**:
- Confirm both devices on same WiFi network
- Check firewall settings on computer
- Verify IP address in app matches connection settings

**Files not visible**:
- Check folder permissions
- Ensure files are in the configured root directory
- Try refreshing the FTP client directory listing

**Performance issues**:
- Close other VR apps to free memory
- Use wired connection for large file transfers
- Enable airplane mode then re-enable WiFi to reset connection

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by checking logcat output:
```bash
adb logcat | grep "FTP\|SimpleFtpServer"
```
